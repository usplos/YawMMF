This package offers convenient and effective functions for mixed model.

* `EffectSize()` : to calculate the effect size for mixed model;

* `MixedModelDataExplore()` : to explore the dependent vairable (usually a continuous variable)

* `MixedModelDataSummary()` : to summarise your data. (This function is still maturing)

* `MixedModelDummy()` : to generate dummy variables for factor variables.

* `MixedModelDiag()` : to offer advice so as to optimize your model.

* `MixedModelPower()` : to perform the power analysis.

* `MixedModelPlot()` : to draw bar plot, interaction line plot, violin plus box plot, violin plus rawdata plot.

* `MixedModelWrite()` : to write the fixed effects of the given model or the descriptive inforamtion of the given dependent variable into yourdisk 
(only works only works for one model at one time)

* `MixedModelWrite2()`: to write the fixed effects of the given model or the descriptive inforamtion of the given dependent variable into yourdisk
(works for multiple models at one time)

* `CorrPlot()` : to draw correlation-matrix plot for multiple-variable correlations 

* `contr.simple()` : to set the contrast matrix of factor variables as simple contrast.
